This is the model for website in which you can change layout of the page, and for this feature jQuery and flexbox are used. This page also has feature for weather information in which you can enter location and get weather information for that location, and for this feature I used OpenWeatherMap API, and used Get method with fetch, for this part vanilla JS was used. For entire project SASS was used.
